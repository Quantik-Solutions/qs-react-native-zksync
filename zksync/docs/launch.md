# Launching zkSync

This document covers common scenarios of launching zkSync applications set locally.

## Prerequisites

Prepare dev environment prerequisites: see [setup-dev.md](setup-dev.md).

## Setup local dev environment

Setup:

```sh
zksync init
```

During the first initialization you have to download around 8 GB of setup files, this should be done once.
If you have a problem on this step of the initialization, see help for the `zksync plonk-setup` command.

To completely reset the dev environment:

- Stop services:
  ```sh
  zksync dev-down
  ```
- Repeat the setup procedure above

If `zksync init` has already been executed, and now you only need to start docker containers (e.g. after reboot), simply launch:

```sh
zksync dev-up
```

## (Re)deploy db and contra—Åts:

```sh
zksync redeploy
```

## Environment configurations

Env config files are held in `etc/env/`

List configurations:

```sh
zksync env
```

Switch between configurations:

```sh
zksync env <ENV_NAME>
```

Default confiruration is `dev.env`, which is generated automatically from `dev.env.example` during `zksync init` command execution.

## Build and run server + prover locally for development:

Run server:

```sh
zksync server
```

Server is configured using env files in `./etc/env` directory. 
After the first initialization, file `./etc/env/dev.env` will be created. By default, this file is copied from the `./etc/env/dev.env.example` template.

Server can produce block of different sizes, the list of available sizes is determined by the `SUPPORTED_BLOCK_CHUNKS_SIZES` environment variable.
Block sizes which will actually be produced by the server can be configured using the `BLOCK_CHUNK_SIZES` environment variable.

Note: for proof generation for large blocks requires a lot of resources and an average user machine 
is only capable of creating proofs for the smallest block sizes. As an alternative, a dummy-prover may be used for development (see [`development.md`](development.md)
for details).

Run prover:

```sh
zksync prover
```

Make sure you have environment variables set right, you can check it by running:
`zksync env`. You should see `* dev` in output.
